PFAC is an open source, high-performance string matching library supporting NVIDIA GPUs.

# Introduction #

**PFAC** library is based on the _Parallel Failureless-AC_ Algorithm<sup>1</sup> proposed at the IEEE GLOBECOM 2010.


# Details #
The PFAC algorithm efficiently exploits the parallelism of the **Aho-Corasick** algorithm by creating an individual thread for each byte of an input stream to identify any pattern starting at the threadâ€™s starting position. The number of threads created by the PFAC algorithm is equal to the length of an input stream.
